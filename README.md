## ⚙️ Initial Setup

After install, go to Tools → CLIP Installer. Click **Initial Setup** to:

- It will be placed in  
   `Assets/StreamingAssets/clipunity-vX.Y.Z/[windows|macos]/`.
- Refresh the AssetDatabase if you don't see it

⚠️ Remove existing binaries (under the StreamingAssets folder) and re-run Initial Setup after updating to a new version tag.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Editor: Preprocess Sprites (Required)

Open **Tools → CLIP Editor** and click **Process Images** (with your folder):

```csharp
// Editor-only
CLIP.ProcessImages("Assets/MySprites");
```

Indexing may take a while. An index.pt file will be created at Application.persistentDataPath.

Note that you need to index the images again if you add/remove items from the folder.

### Live Search (Editor Window)

In the same window:

- Click **Start Search Session**
- Wait for 🟢 “Ready”
- Enter a prompt, adjust Top K & Threshold
- See thumbnail results update live as you type

### Runtime Example (C#)

```csharp
// In your game code:
var runtime = new CLIPRuntime(threshold: 0.6f);
runtime.Start();
string[] matches = runtime.Query("blue-haired warriors", 10);
runtime.Stop();

// `matches` contains the filenames of images that match your prompt.
```

## 🎯 Requirements

- Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer
- .NET 4.x Equivalent scripting runtime
- Internet access only required for the one-time initial download of the CLIP binaries; all searching is offline.
